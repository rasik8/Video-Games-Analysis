# Video Games Analysis

## The Data

This was my second data analysis project. The data set that I used for this analysis was downloaded from Kaggle, it comprises of video game sales for 16,599 games, which have sales greater than 100,000 copies. The dataset provides the following information:

•	**Rank** - Ranking of overall sales

•	**Name** - The games name

•	**Platform** - Platform of the games release (i.e., PC, PS4, etc.)

•	**Year** - Year of the game's release

•	**Genre** - Genre of the game

•	**Publisher** - Publisher of the game

•	**NA_Sales** - Sales in North America (in millions)

•	**EU_Sales** - Sales in Europe (in millions)

•	**JP_Sales** - Sales in Japan (in millions)

•	**Other_Sales** - Sales in the rest of the world (in millions) 

•	**Global_Sales** - Total worldwide sales.

## Data Investigation

After analysing survey data, I explored what insights I could derive. Here are my questions to answer:

1.	What are the top 5 best-selling games globally?
2.	Which video game genre generated the most sales globally?
3.	Which video game genre generated the most sales across different regions?
4.   What are the top 5 video game publishers globally?
5.   What are the top 5 popular video game platforms?
