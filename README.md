# Video Games Analysis

## The Data

This was my second data analysis project. The data set that I used for this analysis was downloaded from Kaggle, it comprises of video game sales for 16,599 games, which have sales greater than 100,000 copies. The dataset provides the following information:

- **Rank** - Ranking of overall sales
- **Name** - The games name
- **Platform** - Platform of the games release (i.e., PC, PS4, etc.)
- **Year** - Year of the game's release
- **Genre** - Genre of the game
- **Publisher** - Publisher of the game
- **NA_Sales** - Sales in North America (in millions)
- **EU_Sales** - Sales in Europe (in millions)
- **JP_Sales** - Sales in Japan (in millions)
- **Other_Sales** - Sales in the rest of the world (in millions) 
- **Global_Sales** - Total worldwide sales.

## Data Investigation

After analysing survey data, I explored what insights I could derive. Here are my questions to answer:

 - **1.	What are the top 5 best-selling games globally?**
 - **2.	Which video game genre generated the most sales globally?**
 - **3.	Which video game genre generated the most sales across different regions?**
 - **4.   What are the top 5 video game publishers globally?**
 - **5.   What are the top 5 popular video game platforms?**

## Observation

1.	Based on this data set will sports is the highest selling game worldwide, with unit sales of 82.74 million. Will sports was released in 2006 which is a sports game, developed by Nintendo.

2.	Action video games were the most popular genre with unit sales of 1.751 billion this was followed by sports games then shooter games.

3.	From my observation North America had the highest game sales followed by Europe then Japan. North America also has the highest sales for every genre, with the exception of role-playing games, where Japan topped sales for this type of game.

4.	Nintendo is the highest grossing game publisher with global unit sales of 1.786 Billion. Unsurprising is the fact that the top 10 games are all published by Nintendo! This could be because of the fact that the Wii system was one of the most innovative consoles of its time by taking advantage of motion controls.

5.	On a global level, most popular platform for gaming is PS2. Game sale for the PS2 grossed to 1.255 billion units sold. The PS2 console launched in 2000 and yet still the unbeaten compared to even to its upgrade PS3.

## Tools used during analysis

This dashboard was built using Excel and advanced Excel functions such as pivot tables and charts. I have included slicers with this dashboard to further filter the data, so you can view game sales by genre, year the game was release, or a combination of two for key information analysis.
